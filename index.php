        <h2>35 years of working women</h2>
        <p>At Working Women Community Centre we believe that immigrant women are at the core of successful families and thriving communities. By empowering immigrant women we help create more engaged mothers, daughters, colleagues and members of the community. In fact, studies have shown that when a woman is given an opportunity to realize her full potential, we all are better for it.</p>
